# ohai-solo Omnibus project

This project creates full-stack platform-specific packages for
`ohai-solo`! `ohai-solo` is a sandboxed distribution of Chef's
[Ohai](https://github.com/opscode/ohai) system profiler with extra plugins from
our [ohai-plugins](https://github.com/rackerlabs/ohai-plugins) repo.

## Installation

We'll assume you have Ruby 1.9+ and Bundler installed. First ensure all
required gems are installed and ready to use:

```shell
$ bundle install --binstubs
```

## Usage

### Build

You create a platform-specific package using the `build project` command:

```shell
$ bin/omnibus build project ohai-solo
```

The platform/architecture type of the package created will match the platform
where the `build project` command is invoked. So running this command on say a
MacBook Pro will generate a Mac OS X specific package. After the build
completes packages will be available in `pkg/`.

### Clean

You can clean up all temporary files generated during the build process with
the `clean` command:

```shell
$ bin/omnibus clean
```

Adding the `--purge` purge option removes __ALL__ files generated during the
build including the project install directory (`/opt/ohai-solo`) and
the package cache directory (`/var/cache/omnibus/pkg`):

```shell
$ bin/omnibus clean --purge
```

### Help

Full help for the Omnibus command line interface can be accessed with the
`help` command:

```shell
$ bin/omnibus help
```

## Vagrant-based Virtualized Build Lab

Every Omnibus project ships will a project-specific
[Berksfile](http://berkshelf.com/) and [Vagrantfile](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
that will allow you to build your projects on the following platforms:

* CentOS 5 64-bit
* CentOS 6 64-bit
* Ubuntu 10.04 64-bit
* Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit
* Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit
* Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit
* Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit
* Debian 6 64-bit
* Debian 7 64-bit

The [vagrant-berkshelf](https://github.com/RiotGames/vagrant-berkshelf) and
[vagrant-omnibus](https://github.com/schisamo/vagrant-omnibus) Vagrant plugins
are also required and can be installed easily with the following commands:

```shell
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus
```

Once the pre-requisites are installed you can build your package across all
platforms with the following command:

```shell
$ vagrant up
```

If you would like to build a package for a single platform the command looks like this:

```shell
$ vagrant up PLATFORM
```

The complete list of valid platform names can be viewed with the
`vagrant status` command.
